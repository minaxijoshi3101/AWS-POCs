command to deploy cloudformation template:
aws cloudformation deploy --template VPC.yaml --stack stackName

Delete a cloudformation template
aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack stackName

we will have limited subnets requirement in any organization, so we create one by one in cloudformation template
    - no looping required
    creation of 100 subnets is not a practical scenario
    subnets are created as environment wise
